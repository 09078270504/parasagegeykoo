                    <strong>My Gegey,</strong>
                    <p>                          
                        I'm so happy to be part of your life and to witness your achievements. You know, every time I reread your letters,  I find myself smiling at your pondering:  "What could possibly be the good thing I did in my previous life to be with you?" It's fascinating how the universe weaves its patterns, guiding us to where we are right now. I'm convinced it's not about what either of us did in the past, but rather the universe's intuition that we were meant to find ourselves silently falling in love with each other. Like Pabbie, I love you without knowing how, or when, or from where. I love you simply, without problems or pride: I love you in this way because I do not know any other way of loving but this.

                        Love, of all the moments we've shared, this one stands outâ€”our senior high times. I remember when we exchanged words again after a long time, how our conversations flowed effortlessly, and how our connection grew deeper with each passing day (wasn't aware it was going deeper tho). It feels like just yesterday when we roamed the corridors of senior high and pondered what would happen after I left high school. How I wish I could tell younger Shania and Gegey to not worry because our relationship grew stronger despite the challenges we experienced.

                            At ngayon, graduate na ang Gegey ko. Pareho na nating nilisan ang lugar na iyon, ngunit ang mga ala-ala ng ating simula ay mananatili doon.

I have seen your strength and resilience, and I know you are capable of achieving anything you set your mind to. The world is wide open before you, filled with endless possibilities and opportunities.
                        <br><br> 
                        Always remember that no matter where life takes you, I will be here, cheering you on and supporting you in every way I can. Together, we will celebrate your victories and navigate any challenges that come our way.
